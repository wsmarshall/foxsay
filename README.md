A take on the original 'Cowsay' (written in Perl at first). A seemingly useless CLI program, still popular today among Unix server admins. Constructed for didactic purposes.

Uses Clap for command-line argument parsing. Has options for positional arguments, binary flags, and options with default values and added descriptions. 

Has color as console printing output uptions, file IO, standard input, output, and error options. 

Incorporates some integration testing. 

With thanks to S. Lyu and A. Rzeznik for helpful guidance.
